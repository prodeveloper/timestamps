SQL For Timestamps
==========

I generally use MySql workbench to design and synchronize my databases.

I also like eloquent timestamps, the script main.php. Is meant to generate an SQL statement that when run adds the timestamp columns created_at and updated_at that eloquent requires.

This is not a stable script use at your own risk
